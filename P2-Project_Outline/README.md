# Project Outline


### Overview
I have been working as a pizza delivery driver for several years now, and I meticuously track my tipped earnings, wages, hours, et cetera in a spreadsheet.  I want a mobile app that I can utilize while working to track and search this data.
Making a mobile app will be a bit more complicated and require learning some new languages.  So my minimum viable product will be to make a web version of this app.  Once finished, I will make the mobile version.  Eventually, I would like to expand this idea to allow tracking of expenses for budgeting purposes, tasks to complete, personal notes, and creative projects as well.



### Features
* **User Account:** Users will be able to create an account to contain all of their information. A confirmation email will be sent with a link to confirm account. User information will only be accessible by signing into their account with the correct email and password.

* **Tip/Income Entry:** Each tip entry will contain fields for date/time of entry, order number, customer name, customer address, order total, tip amount, tip type (cash or credit).

* **Search/Sort:** Tip entries will be searchable by all fields so that the user can find past entries for a single customer by name or address.  Entries should also be sortable by category so users can browse through a chronological list of entries or view alphabetically by customer name.

* **Daily Totals:** Users will be able to view daily totals in various categories: number of deliveries, total sales, total tips (cash and/or credit), and hours worked.  Average tip amounts and number of deliveries per hour will also be calculated and shown.

* **Weekly/Monthly Break-downs:** Users will be able to view totals and averages by week, month. Yearly or custom date ranges may be available as well.

* **Graphic Visualization of Data and Calendar:** Users will be able to view data in graphs or charts to easily find trends or patterns in business.  A calendar view would also be helpful for users to see entries by chronology.



### Web Technologies (MVP)
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* C#
* .NET / Entity Framework

### Mobile Technologies
* React Native ?
* Flutter ?
* Firebase ?
* Javascript ?



### What I'll Have to Learn
For the web version I will review LaunchCode Unit 3 assignments and should be pretty simple to get running.  I will focus on refining the site design and user experience to be responsive to any screen size so it is viewable on desktop and mobile screens.
To make a mobile app I will have to learn a new language (maybe two).  The technologies above were recommended to me by programmer friends.
